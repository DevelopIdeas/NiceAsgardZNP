The Nice Asgard Project (element14/Texas Instruments Ultimate Road Test)
------
NiceAsgardZNP contains the main files for the ZigBee portion of the system.

It is made up of example files of APIs produced by TI and modified to send the messages required for this project.

NO guaranty is provided with this software. It may well not work at all.

Uses TI CC2530 ZigBee Network Processor Mini Development Kit.

This repo is split into three main parts, the common files (Drivers, ZNP API etc), the Coordinator device code and the End Device code.
For use with your devices, the addresses listed in the program will need to change to reflect those of the modules being used.
